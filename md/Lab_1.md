Lab 1. Build a Chatbot using Python/Flask
========================================

This lab shows how to create a simple chatbot in Python & Flask
using the ChatterBot library. Our bot will be used for small talk, as
well as to answer some math questions. Here, weâ€™ll scratch the surface
of whatâ€™s possible in building custom chatbots and NLP in general.

Letâ€™s talk about Chatterbot, with the help of which we are planning to
build our chatbot using Python/Flask.

**ChatterBot** is a Python library that makes it easy to generate
automated responses to a userâ€™s input. ChatterBot uses a selection of
machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses.
This makes it easy for developers to create chat bots and automate
conversations with users.Â 

An example of typical input would be something like this:

```
user: Good morning! How are you doing?
bot:  I am doing very well, thank you for asking.
user: You're welcome.
bot:  Do you like hats?
```

### How ChatterBot Works

ChatterBot is a Python library designed to make it easy to create
software that can engage in conversation.

AnÂ untrained instanceÂ of
ChatterBot starts off with no knowledge of how to communicate. Each time
a user enters aÂ statement,
the library saves the text that they entered and the text that the
statement was in response to. As ChatterBot receives more input the
number of responses that it can reply and the accuracy of each response
in relation to the input statement increase.

The program selects the closest
matchingÂ [response](https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/glossary.html#term-response)Â by
searching for the closest matching known statement that matches the
input, it then chooses a response from the selection of known responses
to that statement.

#### Letâ€™s build our chatbot ðŸ™‚

### Installing dependencies

```
pip3 install chatterbot chatterbot_corpus
```

### Importing Classes â€“ Getting started!!

```
from chatterbot import ChatBot
from chatterbot.trainers import ChatterBotCorpusTrainer
from chatterbot.trainers import ListTrainer
```

### Creating the bot

We are creating a Flask app, to get started with Flask, you can visit
[***here***](https://www.flaskapi.org/)

```
app = Flask(__name__)
#bot = ChatBot("Pikachu")
```

We can create and train the bot by creating an instance of ListTrainer
and supplying it with the lists of strings:

```
trainer = ListTrainer(bot)
```

Getting started with the training part, there are different ways how we
can train the bot, by this,

```
trainer.train(['What is your name?', 'My name is Pikachu'])
trainer.train(['How are you?', 'I am good' ])
trainer.train(['Bye?', 'Bye, see you later' ])
```

or, we can also train by this,

```
conversation = [
    "Hello",
    "Hello!!",
    "How are you doing?",
    "I'm doing great.",
    "That is good to hear",
    "Thank you.",
    "You're welcome."
]

trainer.train(conversation)
```

### Training the Bot with corpus of data

You can use your own or an existing corpus of data to train a bot. For
example, you can use some corpus provided by chatterbot (inbuilt
features):

```
corpus_trainer = ChatterBotCorpusTrainer(bot)
corpus_trainer.train('chatterbot.corpus.english')
```

TheÂ **run()**Â method of Flask class runs the application on the local
development server.

```
@app.route("/")
def home():    
    return render_template("home.html") 
@app.route("/get")
def get_bot_response():    
    userText = request.args.get('msg')    
    return str(bot.get_response(userText)) 
if __name__ == "__main__":    
    app.run()
```

Yay, our first model is ready, letâ€™s test our bot.\
The above givenÂ **Python**Â script is executed from Python shell. \


Go to terminal, and run the below command:

```
python app.py
```

Below message in Python shell is seen, which indicates that our App is
now hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or localhost:5000

```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
